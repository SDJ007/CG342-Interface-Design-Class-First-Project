      <p>:( im so upset right now bro. You're really grinding my gears! AGH! I'm... I'm sorry man. I shouldn't take my own frustrations out on you. If you wanna hang, please feel free. As men, it's our responsibility to manage our emotions in a healthy way, instead of bottling them up. We ought to bring each other up and not tear each other down. My bad bro. I'm gonna work harder to be a more emotionally mature homie. </p>
